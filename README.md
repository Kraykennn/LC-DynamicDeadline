# DynamicDeadline
Just a simple mod that increases the deadline along with the quota increase.

# Installation
1. Install BepInEx.
2. Run your game once with BepInEx installed to generate the necessary folders and files.
3. Move the "DynamicDeadline.dll" from the DynamicDeadline/BepInEx/plugins folder to the BepInEx/plugins folder in your Lethal Company game directory.
4. You're done!

# Plans for the future
Allow the "scrap per day" dividing factor to be customizable by the host of the game.

# Special Notice/Thanks
This is my first attempt at a mod for the game Lethal Company. I plan for this to be a stepping stone on to more complicated and feature rich mods.

Special thanks to discord user Mama Llama for answering the majority of my questions in regards to learning how to make mods for Lethal Company.
