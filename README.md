# DynamicDeadline
Just a simple mod that increases the deadline along with the quota increase.

### Installation
1. Install BepInEx.
2. Run your game once with BepInEx installed to generate the necessary folders and files.
3. Move the "DynamicDeadline.dll" from the DynamicDeadline/BepInEx/plugins folder to the BepInEx/plugins folder in your Lethal Company game directory.
4. Run the game once to generate the config file for the mod.
5. Modify the Config Haha.DynamicDeadlin.cfg and change the setting DailyScrapValue to an amount of scrap 
5. You're done!

### Special Notice
This is my first attempt at making a mod for the game Lethal Company. I plan for this to be a stepping stone on to more complicated and feature rich mods.

### Special thanks to:
- Discord user Mama Llama for answering the majority of my questions in regards to learning how to make mods for Lethal Company. 
- Discord user Sov for helping me fix the errors I encountered with such a simple mod and teaching me how to create the config option.
