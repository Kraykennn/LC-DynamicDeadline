# DynamicDeadline
Just a simple mod that increases the deadline along with the quota increase.

# Installation
1. Install BepInEx
2. Run game once with BepInEx installed to generate necessary folders and files
3. Move the "DynamicDays.Dll" from DynamicDays/BepInEx/plugins to the BepInEx/plugins folder in your Lethal Company game directory.
4. You're done!

# Plans for the future
Allow the "scrap per day" dividing factor to be customizable by the host of the game.

# Special Notice/Thanks
This is my first attempt at a mod for the game Lethal Company. I plan for this to be a stepping stone on to more complicated and feature rich mods.

Special thanks to discord users: 
Mama Llama, for answering the majority of my questions in regards to learning how to make mods for Lethal Company.
